FIGURES
=======

1.  Centroid-spaced figures. Operates in a single voice. First version with
    three input parameters: pitch-class set; ContourSpecifier (derived from
    RegistrationSpecifier but with notions of absolute octave removed to allow
    formalization of pure contour); centroid pitch. Figure contours
    pitch-classes according to contour specifier in dummy octave. Figure then
    octave-transposes contoured figure to octave with best-match centroid.
    generalized input: list of 1 or more pitch-class sets; list of 1 or more
    contour specifiers; list of 1 or more centroids. Figure braids input and
    generates crossproduct. Indexing crossproduct happens external to
    figure-maker.

2.  Generalized successive transforms. Operates in a single voice. First
    version with six input parameters: list of 1 or more pitch-class sets; list
    of 0 or more pitch-class transforms including arbitrary permutation;
    optional repartition specifier; list of 1 or more registration specifiers;
    list of 0 or more simultaneity specifiers; list of 1 or more rhythm-makers.
    Figure outputs crossproduct. Repartition specifier allows differently sized
    output cells. Registration specifiers allow disjunct register.

3.  Process that develops release points of a series of notes held constant in
    their span durations. Consider a series of consecutive notes carrying the
    span duration of a quarter each. Small rests begin gradually to consume the
    end (or begin) parts of each span. Then larger rests consume the end (or
    begin) parts of each span. At quick or moderate tempi the effect modulates
    legato. At slower tempi the effect re-colors one-note events. Process need
    not carry the affect of interpolation: discrete changes in durations of
    end-part rests will cause correspondingly discreet changes in legato.
    Written-out legato transforms. || Second version scales legato-controlled
    line with accelerandi or ritardandi. || Third version repartitions material
    discontiguously throughout the piece. || Fourth version groups
    rest-delimited notes together under phrase marks.

4.  there's a type "span modulation" available within these legato-controlled
    lines. observe first that each span comprises a "sounding" part and an
    (optional) silent part; then it is clear that these legato-controlled lines
    are just those lines in which the ratio between the sounding and silent
    parts vary between spans. then a technique available is suddenly to shrink
    the duration of each span down to that of only the sounding part of the
    current span. so the name of the technique is something like '(subito) span
    adjustment'. and duration of either the sounding part or silent part of the
    current span can be acquired as the duration of the spans that follow
    after. an important consequnce of this type of span adjustment is the
    immediate installation of legato from note to note immediately after.

5.  there's another type of line available as a result of the independent
    control of the sounding and silent parts of each span: successions of notes
    in which the sounding part of each span is kept constant while span
    duration is made to vary. tuplet monads make the notation of all cases
    possible.

6.  an antecedent / consequent variation pattern may be derived from the
    independent control of sounding and silent span parts described here. and
    that is the statement of a phrase two times such that attack times repeat
    exactly but that the sounding durations of the first phrase are
    considerably shorter than those of the second phrase, or vice versa. attack
    point constancy with sounding part variation.

7.  first voice in running figuration over the course of approximately a wide
    octave centered in, for example, the fourth octave. second voice introduced
    as interrmittent conccurrent attacks also in the fourth octave though
    always below the note currently sounding in the upper voice strictly to
    avoid voice crossing. color variation follows from written duration
    variation of the notes in the lower voice. upper voice is a stream and
    lower voice is a rest-interpolated line. || second version develops
    internally the durations of the notes of the lower voice. from coequal in
    duration to the notes of the upper voice to three or four times the
    duration of the notes in the upper voice and back again. || third version
    develops internally the written durations of the notes of the upper voice
    while keeping constant the span durations of the notes of the upper voice.
    (denote by 'span duration' the duration of a note added to the durations of
    the any rests that follow the note.)

8.  there's a certain type of contour application that's interesting. a
    sinus-type contour given by [..., 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, ...]. has a
    certain feeling in the hand. can probabaly be played almost always with a
    single hand (which means that two different versions of the figure can be
    played against in each in the same rhythm or in contrasting rhythms).
    probably pivots around the thumb. is relatively wide figuration but is not
    a type of up- or down-arpeggiation. and is centered on a single octave.
    although register interpolation can be applied and the whole thing can move
    gradually up or down. call this something like "sinus contour".

9.  (legato) parallel dyads. in the simplest case parallel thirds, sixths,
    fourths or fifths. seconds and sevenths are also interesting and absent
    from the tonal repertory. parallelism can be diatonic, chromatic, mixed.
    primary attraction is that the technique can be truly legato even in a
    single hand (at least when kept to the interval of at most a sixth). notes
    all carry equal duration and move uniformly up or uniformly down in the
    base case. || second version snakes the train of parallels intervals both
    up and down over the course of the figure, though always overly relatively
    small intervals to ensure the efficacy of the legato. || third version
    inserts some longer notes, though still tutti legato. || fourth version
    slurs groups together. || fifth version interpolates rests after some
    dyads. || sixth version interpolates rests after all dyads. || seventh
    version combines from all of these together. || there's an open question as
    to the pitch field that underlies the dyads (and therefore controls their
    successive qualities).

10. chordal up-parallelism and chordal down-parallelism. three or more pitches
    in the parallelized chord. preferrably five or six. spacing as tight as
    possible. can work extremely well in the very low registers.

11. then there's the question of how to work with (probabaly arpeggiated)
    ostinati. in the base case the ostinati are probabaly legato. variations
    treat the notes of the ostinati with different values of interporlated
    rest. may be enough just to ensure pitch continuance in one or more other
    voices during all or part of the life an ostinato. differently pitched
    ostinati can also overlap. there needn't be harmonic motion between the
    ostinati if the notes of the ostinati are taken from a (tightly spaced)
    string. if the overlapping, different-pitched ostinati comprise notes of
    (slightly) different durations then there's the possibility of using
    contrasting slur types to shape progression of ostinati from one to the
    next. in this case the ostinati proceed according to two voices moving
    slowly in a type of macrohocket. || second version adds a third voice in
    pointillist counterpoint to the pair of voices that carry the ostinati.

12. contrasting slur types. first version sets just two slur types against each
    other. perhaps solid versus dashed. or perhaps two different types of
    dashed slur. probably the greater the gapping in the slur type the greater
    the degree of gapping between the notes the slur governs. first version
    deploys the slur types in alternation. || second version overlaps
    (momentarily) the slur types. || third version layers (continuously) the
    slur types. || a compositional question arises immediately as to the
    relationship between the piece's special slur types and the piece's
    explicitly legato-controlled lines. are some (or all) of the special slur
    types set equal to some of the legato-controlled lines? or not?

13. spans with durations equal to a whole note or more but with a very short
    sounding parts. special type of jewel that will let shine the durationcolor
    of each span.

14. trills internal to any of the special types of legato-controlled lines
    described here.

15. Extremely protracted section-length ritardando. Extremely protracted
    section-length accelerando.

16. Exact metric modulations between sections.

18. Strikingly long single notes. Strikingly long dyads.
