CRÊTES D'ONDES
--------------

1.  Endless quick stream. Continuous prolated thirty-second notes filling
    changing cells equal to two, three or four eighth notes each. Internal
    change animates material with slow change of register: specific type of
    up-lifted-at-end change of contour: ______---^ Material sequences this
    contour-inflection process five or six times, each time starting on a
    start-pitch just barely lower than the time before: effects up-inflected
    down-sequence. Material effects down-directed crescendo from ppp to f in
    continuous even swells. Material can then be partitioned discontiguously
    throughout the piece.

2.  Process of perforation that progresively atomizes endless thirty-second
    note stream. Process carries very far. Terminal edges of process become
    extremely interesting ways of durationcoloring strongly silence-isolated
    thirty-second notes. Process only asymptotically approaches silence: ends
    of process can be used to effect extremely intermittent voice that
    reappears only every 10 - 15 seconds or even more intermittently.

3.  Inverse process of accumulation that proressively assembles atoms into
    chains and then chains into an underlying stream. Important: intermediate
    stages of process imply silence-delimited phrasal segmentation: exact
    rhythms recur throughout the piece. In fact perhaps all perceptually
    phrasal materials derive of the same process or even the same moments of
    the same process.

4.  Crêtes d'ondes: tenuti-inflection upper voice imbricated at the peaks of
    undulating carrier voice in slightly lower register. Voices' pitch material
    of the derive of different cells. Requires only one hand. Striking in
    running durations that are exactly even or that are equal according to
    Chopin correspondences. There's even a three-voice version (crêtes doubles)
    that establishes two separate and intercalated series of peaks overlapping
    in register and differing in dynamics. Leaves the other hand available for
    rhythmically independent second stratum of possibly more crêtes d'ondes.

5.  Sixteenth-note crêtes d'ondes.

6.  Eighth-note crêtes d'ondes.

7.  Quarter-valued crêtes d'ondes.

8.  Half-valued crêtes d'ondes.

9.  Whole-valued crêtes d'ondes.

DURATION-COLORED LEGATO
-----------------------

1.  Lines built of spans each comprising an (optional) sounding part and
    (optional) silent part. Examples: [8. r16 8. r16 8. r16 etc.] or [8.. r16
    8.. r16 8.. r16 etc.] or [8 r8. 8 r8. 8 r8. etc.].

2.  Highly intermittent durationcolored material. Large-duration spans with
    very short sounding parts let durationcolors shine.

3.  Constant span / changing sound. Consider a series of consecutive notes
    carrying the span duration of a quarter each. Small rests begin gradually
    to consume the end (or begin) parts of each span. Then larger rests consume
    the end (or begin) parts of each span. At quick or moderate metronome_marks the
    effect modulates legato. At slower metronome_marks the effect re-colors one-note
    events. Process need not interpolate: discrete changes in durations of
    end-part rests cause correspondingly discreet changes in legato. Second
    version changes span durations additively. Third version repartitions
    material discontiguously. Fourth version applies phrase marks.

4.  Subito legato. Remove silent parts all at once.

5.  Subito détaché. Insert silent parts all at once.
    
6.  Variable span / constant sound. Span duration varies while sounding
    duration remains the same.

7.  Attackpoint preservation with variable sounding part. Exact series of span
    durations repeats multiple times with attackpoints constant but sounding
    durations different.
