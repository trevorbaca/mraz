TO-DO:

1.  Port Dornen.

2.  Set up Dornen Travis tests.

3.  Design cover.

4.  Build designs.

5.  Equip SegmentMaker with label_voices property.

6.  Extend selectors to work with named figures.

7.  Extend RegistrationSpecifier:
    * centroid spacing
    * ChordalSpacingSpecifier
    * multistage (breakpoin) contour specification

8.  Extend FigureMaker with optional pitch-class transforms.

9.  Extend FigureMaker with optional RepartitionSpecifier.

10. Extend FigureMaker with list of 0 or more SimultaneitySpecifier objects.

11. Build many crossproduct makers.

12. Generalize voice intermittency.
    Denote by C a first cell; call C the (voice-)reference cell.
    Denote by D a second cell; call D the (voice-)dependent cell.
    Allow any leaf D_j in D to coincide with any leaf C_i in C.
    Extend to allow any E_in in E to coincide with any D_i in D, recursively.

13. Integrate formalizations of all three pedals.

14. Extend FigureMaker with ClusterSpecifier.

15. Integrate resonance depressed pitches.
    Extend resonance pitches with the middle pedal.

SCOPE:

1.  Only two staves.
