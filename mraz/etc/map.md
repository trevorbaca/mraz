1.  Endless quick stream. Continuous prolated thirty-second notes filling
    changing cells equal to two, three or four eighth notes each. Internal
    change animates material with slow change of register: specific type of
    up-lifted-at-end change of contour: ______---^ Material repeats sequences
    this contour-inflection process five or six times, each time starting on a
    start-pitch just barely lower than the time before: effects up-inflected
    down-sequence. Material effects longterm crescendo from ppp to f in
    continuous even swells: effects down-directed crescendo. Material can then
    be partitioned discontiguously throughout the piece.

2.  Process of perforation that progresively atomizes endless thirty-second
    note stream. Process carries very far. Terminal edges of process become
    extremely interesting ways of durationcoloring strongly silence-isolated
    and duration-colored thirty-second notes. Process only asymptotically
    approaches silence: extreme ends of process can be used to effect extremely
    intermittent voice that reappears only every 10 - 15 seconds or even more
    intermittently. Potentially strong bringer of intermittency.

3.  Inverse process of accumulation that proressively assembles atoms into
    chains and then chains into an underlying stream. Important: intermediate
    stages of process imply (silence-delimited) phrasal segmentation: exact
    rhythms recur throughout the piece. In fact perhaps all perceptually
    phrasal materials derive of the same process or even the same moments of
    the same process.

4.  Crêtes d'ondes: tenuti-inflection upper voice imbricated at the peaks of 
    undulating carrier voice in slightly lower register. Pitch material of the
    voices deriving of different cells. Requires only a single hand. Striking
    in running durations that are exactly even or that are equal according to
    Chopin correspondences. There's even a three-voice version (crêtes doubles)
    that establishes two separate and intercalated series of peaks overlapping
    in register and differing in dynamics. Leaves the other hand available:
    resonance effects; rhythmically independent second stratum (possibly again
    of crêtes d'ondes) run faster or slower or at roughly the same rate;
    completely contrasting second process.

5.  Sixteenth-note crêtes d'ondes.

6.  Eighth-note crêtes d'ondes.

7.  Quarter-valued crêtes d'ondes.

8.  Half-valued crêtes d'ondes.

9.  Whole-valued crêtes d'ondes.

10. Fundamentally different durationcolored material. All forms of line carry
    in-built rests between each note, which differs fundamentally from
    thirtysecond-, sixteenth- or eighth-valued streams. Conceptually all
    end-positioned out-carved silences at the end of each note: [8. r16 8. r16
    8. r16 etc.] or [8.. r16 8.. r16 8.. r16 etc.] or [8 r8. 8 r8. 8 r8. etc.]
    These are the base carriers for durationcolor in the piece.

11. Specific application of successive transforms: alternating alpha-inverse
    chaining to identity of input pitch-class sets. Second version carries
    process to identity a second time with ongoing changes in register and
    dynamics governing both cycles. Third version carries process to identity a
    third time.
