MOMENTS
=======

1.  Protracted period of extremely quick icy writing in the highest major tenth
    of the instrument. Continues for incredibly long time. Then continues even
    longer while effecting protracted crescendo. Then continues even longer at
    maximally loud fffff.

17. two too-long notes in the middle register. perhaps just an ascending major
    second. strking when they occur just after more elaborate figuration in the
    upper or lower registers.
