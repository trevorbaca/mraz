RESONANCE
=========

1.  Senza risonanza (SR).

2.  Shadow: (M- or H-)held single pitch (or set).

3.  (M- or H-)held cluster.

4.  All dampers up.

5.  Up-shadow: shadow 1; shadow 2 (up by step); shadow 3 (up by step).

6.  Down-shadow: shadow 1; shadow 2 (down by step); shadow 3 (down by step).

7.  Up-tier: SR; M-held set; bigger M-held set; all dampers up.

8.  Down-tier: all dampers up; M-held set; smaller M-held set; SR.

9.  Senza / shadow alternation: SR; shadow 1; SR shadow 1 ...

10. Shadow / cluster alternation: shadow; cluster; shadow; cluster ...

11. Senza / shadow / cluster cycles: SR; shadow; cluster; SR; shadow; cluster
    ...

12. Senza / shadow / cluster waves: SR; shadow; cluster; shadow; SR; shadow;
    cluster; shadow; SR ...
      
13. Chordal field-leading: M-held chord; nondisjunct M-held chord; nondisjunct
    M-held chord ...

14. Curtailed skim: attack M-held pitch and then subito release M middecay.

PALETTE
-------

1.  Resonator configurations: single string; dyad; white cluster; black
    cluster; chromatic cluster; overtone-spaced field; tightly-spaced set;
    widely-spaced set.

2.  Impulse principle: louder dynamics resonate greater number of partials.
    Pull towards fffff.

3.  Subjacency: tightly-spaced h-held set excited by tightly-spaced foreign
    chord attacked sforzando immediately above.

4.  Curtailed subjacency: tightly-spaced h-held set excited by tightly-spaced
    foreign chord attacked sforzando immediately above; h-set released subito
    middecay.

STEP-SHADOW COMBINATIONS
------------------------

1.  Through-composed up-shadow: music with shadow 1; music with shadow 2 (up by
    step); music with shadow 3 (up by step).

2.  Through-composed down-shadow: music with shadow 1; music with shadow 2
    (down by step); music with shadow 3 (down by step).

3.  Cycled up-shadow: figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with shadow 2 (up by
    step); figure 1 with shadow 3 (up by step).

4.  Cycled down-shadow: figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with shadow 2 (down by
    step); figure 1 with shadow 3 (down by step).
