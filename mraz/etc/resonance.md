RESONANCE
=========

1.  Resonator configurations: single string; dyad; white cluster; black
    cluster; chromatic cluster; overtone-spaced field; tightly-spaced set;
    widely-spaced set.

2.  Up-tiering: senza risonanza; then M-held set; then M-held set with
    hand-held cluster; then all dampers raised.

3.  Down-tiering: all dampers raised; then hand-held cluster with M-held set;
    then M-held set; then senza risonanza.

4.  Up-shadow: music with shadow 1; music with shadow 2 (up by step); music
    with shadow 3 (up by step); etc.

5.  Down-shadow: music with shadow 1; music shadow 2 (down by step); music with
    shadow 3 (down by step); etc.

6.  Cycled up-shadow: figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with shadow 2 (up by
    step); figure 1 with shadow 3 (up by step); etc.

7.  Cycled down-shadow: figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with shadow 2 (down by
    step); figure 1 with shadow 3 (down by step); etc.

8.  Senza / shadow alternation: figure 1 senza risonanza; figure 1 with shadow
    1; figure 1 senza risonanza; figure 1 with shadow 1; etc.

9.  Shadow / flare alternation: figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with cluster
    flare; figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with cluster flare; etc.

10. Senza / shadow / flare cycles: figure 1 senza risonanza; figure 1 with
    shadow 1; figure 1 with flare 1; figure 1 senza risonanza; figure 1 with
    shadow 1; figure 1 with flare 1; etc.

11. Senza / shadow / flare undulation: figure 1 senza risonanza; figure 1 S1;
    figure 1 L1; figure 1 S1; figure 1 senza risonanza; figure 1 S1; figure 1
    L1; figure 1 S1; figure 1 senza risonanza; etc.
      
12. Chordal field-leading: complex M-configuration; then h-configuration with
    M-swap; then h-configuration with M-swap; etc.

13. Skim: attack M-held pitch. Attack-dependent contrail.

14. Curtailed skim: attack M-held pitch and then subito release M middecay.

15. Subjacency: tightly-spaced h-held set excited by tightly-spaced foreign
    chord attacked sforzando immediately above.

16. Curtailed subjacency: tightly-spaced h-held set excited by tightly-spaced
    foreign chord attacked sforzando immediately above; h-set released subito
    middecay.

17. Impulse principle: louder dynamics resonate greater number of partials.
    Pull towards fffff.
