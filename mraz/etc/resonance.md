RESONANCE
=========

1.  Resonator configurations: single string; dyad; white cluster; black
    cluster; chromatic cluster; overtone-spaced field; tightly-spaced set;
    widely-spaced set.

2.  Impulse principle: louder dynamics resonate greater number of partials.
    Pull towards fffff.

3.  Up-tiering: senza risonanza; then M-held set; then M-held set with
    hand-held cluster; then all dampers raised.

4.  Down-tiering: all dampers raised; then hand-held cluster with M-held set;
    then M-held set; then senza risonanza.

5.  Alternating shadow / no-shadow: figure 1 with resonance configuration 1;
    figure 1 senza risonanza; figure 1 with resonance configuration 1; figure 1
    senza risonanza.

6.  Up-shadow: music with shadow 1; music continues with shadow moving up by
    step to shadow 2; music continues with shadow moving up by step to shadow
    3; music continues with shadow moving up by step to shadow 4; etc.

7.  Cycled up-shadow: figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with shadow 2 (up by
    step); figure 1 with shadow 3 (up by step); figure 1 with shadow 4 (up by
    step).

8.  Alternating shadow / flare: figure 1 with (single-note) shadow 1; figure 1
    with cluster flare; figure 1 with shadow 1; figure 1 with cluster flare.

9.  Skimming: attacking an M-held pitch a single time. Potentially very long
    contrail dependent on attack. 

10. Curtailed skim: attack M-held pitch; then release M before decay completes.
