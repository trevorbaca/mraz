    L1; figure 1 S1; figure 1 senza risonanza; etc.
      
9.  Chordal field-leading: complex M-configuration; then h-configuration with
    M-swap; then h-configuration with M-swap; etc.

10. Skim: attack M-held pitch. Attack-dependent contrail.

11. Curtailed skim: attack M-held pitch and then subito release M middecay.

12. Subjacency: tightly-spaced h-held set excited by tightly-spaced foreign
    chord attacked sforzando immediately above.

13. Curtailed subjacency: tightly-spaced h-held set excited by tightly-spaced
    foreign chord attacked sforzando immediately above; h-set released subito
    middecay.

PALETTE
=======

1.  Resonator configurations: single string; dyad; white cluster; black
    cluster; chromatic cluster; overtone-spaced field; tightly-spaced set;
    widely-spaced set.

2.  Impulse principle: louder dynamics resonate greater number of partials.
    Pull towards fffff.
