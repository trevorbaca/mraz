\textit{ Under stone, under feather, around the edges of fruit bristles ice in
its tracings until morning. So small but so bright it is the crystals in night
that give to the frost its serrations. What tracks are these that back-tread to
dreams in grains that arise and enjamb? }

Mráz is the Czech word for `frost' and it is from imaginings of frozen water
that the unceasingly overlapped voices in the music proceed. The music’s
dynamic contrasts grate the kaleidoscoped, and exceedingly difficult, changes
of rhythmic value effected everywhere between the pianist’s hands. Whether
suggestive of the edges of ice crystals of their facets, the frost in piece’s
conceit should also be understood in their sudden disappearance.
